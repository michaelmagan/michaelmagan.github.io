title: The AI Spreadsheet Google Should Be Building
summary: I've always been a numbers nerd who lived in spreadsheets. Google's AI integration hasn't impressed me, so I built my own.

I've always been kind of a numbers nerd. I loved Moneyball, and somewhere along the way became the person who builds spreadsheets for everythingâ€”budgets, real estate investments, stock portfolios, analysis tools for every job. They're this incredible medium for interactive coding when you don't want to write actual code.

But Google Sheets's AI add-on is still incredibly underwhelming.

So I built CheatSheet: an AI-powered spreadsheet where you can use natural language to interact with your cells. I'm planning to add formulas, graphing, voice input, and more over the next few weeks.

Here's what that looks like:

Try it yourself: [cheatsheet.tambo.co](https://cheatsheet.tambo.co)

The whole thing is [open source](https://github.com/michaelmagan/cheatsheet), built with Tambo (a React SDK for natural language interfaces) and ReactGrid.

P.S. I'm a co-founder of [Tambo](tambo.co), working towards natural language interfaces for every application.
