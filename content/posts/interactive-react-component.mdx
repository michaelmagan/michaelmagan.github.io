MDX supports rendering real React components alongside your prose. Components are
mapped in `src/lib/mdx-components.tsx`, so you can use them directly by name.

Below is a simple, interactive counter:

<Counter initial={3} />

You can pass props too, for example a different step size:

<Counter initial={10} step={2} />

That’s it—interactive UI embedded right inside your blog post.
