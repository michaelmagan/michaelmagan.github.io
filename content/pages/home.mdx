## Howdy!

I'm the founder of [Tambo](https://tambo.co), building a React SDK for Adaptive AI Interfaces. Previously, I worked on LinkinChat and built products at Indeed, Convoy and Taxbit.

I live in Seattle/San Francisco and spend my free time in nature. Sometimes, against my better judgement, I get the idea to climb volcanoes. Usually, I regret it.

The quickest way to reach me is by messaging me on Twitter at [@mrmagan](https://x.com/mrmagan_). I make a point to respond to every DM I get. I’ve met some incredible people through the internet.
