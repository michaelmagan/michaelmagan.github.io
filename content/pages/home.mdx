# Howdy!

I'm the founder of [Tambo](https://tambo.co), building a React SDK for Adaptive AI Interfaces. Previously, I worked on LinkinChat and built products at Indeed, Convoys and Taxbit.

I live in Seattle/San Francisco and spend my free time in nature. Sometimes, against my better judgement, I get the idea to climb volcanoes. Usually, I regret it.
